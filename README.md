# Simple Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case, wherby a user's favorite number can be stored in and called from a smart contract.

The contract is automatically deployed to the Goerli testnet and verified on etherscan (network deployments can be edited in the **hardhat.config.js** file).

Once the repo is cloned, `cd` to the directory in your local environment and run the following commands to deploy to Goerli!

## Deploy to Testnet
Install dependencies: `$ yarn`

Deploy: `$ yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli`
